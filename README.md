## Software

**@Siemens:** Jointly architected a reinforcement learning toolbox, SCS-Reinforce, inside Simcenter Studio with Siemens DI SW. Working together for the next cool features for our customers. Implemented new algorithms for tuning and calibration of power systems.

**@MathWorks:** Key contributions to Control System Toolbox, Robust Control Toolbox, System Identification Toolbox and Reinforcement Learning Toolbox. Some highlights:
Toolbox: Lead engineer and architect in Reinforcement Learning Toolbox including software architecture design, algorithm implementation, and team supervision.
Algorithms: Designed and implemented essential algorithms for MATLAB.
Designed more accurate continuous to discrete conversion algorithm in c2d.
Authored faster and more accurate transfer function estimation algorithm from frequency-domain data in tfest.
Implemented the limited balanced truncation algorithm to reduce model according to energies within time- and frequency-domain intervals.
App Tools: Authored the Model Reducer for model reduction (example) and Control System Tuner for fixed-order distributed controller design (example 1, example 2).

**@University of Leuven:** Designed and implemented a MATLAB toolbox for Analysis and control for time-delay systems. The toolbox includes numerical algorithms for H-infinity norm and pseudospectral abscissa computations and H-infinity controller design using nonsmooth, nonconvex optimization methods.

**@New York University, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences:** Contributed to the MATLAB toolbox for fixed-order controller design (HIFOO). This toolbox solves several key control problems including fixed-order (strong/simultaneous) stabilization, Hâˆž & H2 optimization for mixed problems and multiple plants.
