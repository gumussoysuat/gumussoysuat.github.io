## Software

**@Siemens:** Jointly architected a reinforcement learning toolbox, SCS-Reinforce, inside [Simcenter Studio](https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/products/simcenter/simcenter-studio.html) with Siemens DI SW. Working together for the next cool features for our customers. Implemented new algorithms for tuning and calibration of power systems.

**@MathWorks:** Key contributions to [Control System Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/control.html), [Robust Control Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/robust.html), [System Identification Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/sysid.html) and [Reinforcement Learning Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/reinforcement-learning.html). Some highlights:
<ul>
  <li><b>Toolbox:</b> Lead engineer and architect in <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/reinforcement-learning.html">Reinforcement Learning Toolbox</a> including software architecture design, algorithm implementation, and team supervision.</li>
  <li><b>Algorithms:</b> Designed and implemented essential algorithms for MATLAB.
    <ul>
      <li>Designed more accurate <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/control/ref/c2d.html">continuous to discrete conversion algorithm</a> in c2d.</li>
      <li>Authored faster and more accurate <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/releases/R2016b/ident/ref/tfest.html">transfer function estimation algorithm</a> from frequency-domain data in tfest.</li>
      <li>Implemented the <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/releases/R2016a/control/ref/balred.html">limited balanced truncation algorithm</a> to reduce model according to energies within time- and frequency-domain intervals.</li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>App Tools:</b> Authored the <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/control/ref/modelreducer-app.html">Model Reducer</a> for model reduction (<a href="http://www.mathworks.com/videos/model-order-reduction-with-the-model-reducer-app-118008.html">example</a>) and <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/slcontrol/tuning-with-control-system-tuner.html">Control System Tuner</a> for fixed-order distributed controller design (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stIS32tsbPI">example 1</a>, <a href="http://blogs.mathworks.com/seth/2014/04/03/control-system-tuning-without-guess-or-stress/">example 2</a>).</li>
</ul>

**@University of Leuven:** Designed and implemented a MATLAB toolbox for [analysis and control for time-delay systems](http://twr.cs.kuleuven.be/research/software/delay-control/index.html). The toolbox includes numerical algorithms for [H-infinity norm](http://twr.cs.kuleuven.be/research/software/delay-control/hinf/) and [pseudospectral abscissa](http://twr.cs.kuleuven.be/research/software/delay-control/psa/) computations and [H-infinity controller design](http://twr.cs.kuleuven.be/research/software/delay-control/hinfopt/) using nonsmooth, nonconvex optimization methods.

**@New York University, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences:** Contributed to the [MATLAB toolbox for fixed-order controller design](http://www.cs.nyu.edu/overton/software/hifoo/) (HIFOO). This toolbox solves several key control problems including fixed-order (strong/simultaneous) stabilization, H-infinity & H-2 optimization for mixed problems and multiple plants.
